This project is an assignment from The Odin Project. The objective of the 
project is to replicate a simple webpage using browser developer tools. The
web page that will be copied is the standard Google homepage.
Completing this project should demonstrate familiarity with basic HTML and 
CSS syntax, problem solving, as well as the ability to copy things using the 
developer tools. All problems should be tackled without looking at the
developer tools if possible.
